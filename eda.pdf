As part of the eCommerce dataset project, I conducted an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights and establish a clear understanding of the data. Below are the steps and techniques I used during the process:

Data Collection and Understanding:

I worked with three datasets: Customers.csv, Products.csv, and Transactions.csv.
Each file contained essential information: customer demographics, product details, and transaction records, respectively.
I explored and documented the structure of each dataset, including column descriptions, data types, and unique identifiers.
Data Cleaning:

Identified and handled missing values (e.g., ensuring consistent data for customers and transactions).
Removed duplicate records and corrected inconsistencies in data, such as incorrect dates or misaligned categories.
Standardized formats for key fields, such as dates and currency, to enable smooth analysis.
Data Exploration:

Customers: Analyzed regional distributions, signup trends, and customer demographics to understand audience segments.
Products: Examined product categories, pricing structures, and overall sales contribution of various items.
Transactions: Investigated transaction frequency, total revenue, average order value, and trends over time.
Visualization:

Created meaningful visualizations using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover patterns.
Examples of visualizations included:
A bar chart for top-selling product categories.
A time-series plot showing sales trends across months.
A heatmap correlating customer regions with transaction frequency.
Insights and Findings:

Derived actionable insights, such as:
Identification of high-performing product categories.
Regional trends highlighting underperforming markets.
Seasonal peaks in sales, indicating potential marketing opportunities.
Correlation between customer sign-up dates and transaction frequency.
Products with high demand but lower margins, guiding pricing strategies.
Tools and Libraries Used:

Python Libraries: Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and NumPy for numerical operations.
Jupyter Notebooks: Organized the analysis into logical sections for easy interpretation and reproducibility.
Outcome:
The EDA provided a comprehensive understanding of the eCommerce dataset, enabling the identification of key business trends and areas for improvement. The insights generated serve as a foundation for making informed decisions about customer engagement, product optimization, and marketing strategies.
