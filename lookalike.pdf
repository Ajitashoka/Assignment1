I developed a Lookalike Model leveraging a Siamese Neural Network to recommend customers with similar profiles and transaction histories. The objective was to identify the top 3 lookalike customers for the first 20 customers in the dataset, based on their similarity scores. Below is the detailed breakdown of my approach:

Understanding the Problem:

The task required building a model to calculate similarity between customers using their profiles (Customers.csv) and transactional behavior (Transactions.csv).
The output was a recommendation of the top 3 similar customers for each target customer, along with their similarity scores.
Data Preparation:

Data Merging: Combined the Customers.csv and Transactions.csv files to ensure all relevant features (e.g., region, purchase history) were included for each customer.
Feature Engineering:
Aggregated transactional data to derive features such as total spend, average transaction value, product category preferences, and purchase frequency.
Converted categorical variables (e.g., regions, product categories) into embeddings or one-hot encoded representations.
Data Scaling: Normalized numerical features (e.g., spend, frequency) to ensure uniformity in the input space.
Model Design â€“ Siamese Neural Network:

Architecture:
The Siamese model consisted of two identical neural networks sharing the same weights.
Each network processed customer feature vectors independently and mapped them to a latent embedding space.
A distance metric (e.g., Euclidean or cosine distance) was computed between embeddings to measure customer similarity.
Input Features:
Customer demographic information (e.g., region, tenure).
Aggregated transactional features (e.g., average spend, product preferences).
Loss Function: Used contrastive loss to minimize the distance between embeddings of similar customers and maximize it for dissimilar customers.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Created pairs of customers labeled as "similar" or "dissimilar" based on their transaction histories and profiles.
Split the data into training and testing sets, ensuring a balance of similar and dissimilar pairs.
Trained the Siamese network using a learning rate scheduler for convergence and validated it using metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP).
Recommendation Generation:

Passed the first 20 customers (CustomerIDs: C0001-C0020) through the trained Siamese network to compute their embeddings.
Calculated pairwise similarity scores between these embeddings and the embeddings of all other customers.
Ranked customers based on similarity scores and retrieved the top 3 lookalike customers for each target customer.
Deliverables:

A CSV file (Lookalike.csv) containing a mapping of each target customer to their top 3 similar customers and corresponding similarity scores.
A Jupyter Notebook detailing the implementation, including feature engineering, model training, and similarity calculations.
Outcome:
The Siamese-based Lookalike Model successfully identified customers with similar purchasing behaviors and profiles, providing accurate recommendations. This model lays the foundation for targeted marketing campaigns and personalized customer engagement strategies.
